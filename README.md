# Digital Image Processing
Algorithms related to digital image processing implemented for educational purpose in coherence with course [INF2310](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF2310/).

## Implemented Algorithms/Solutions
### Canny Edge Detector [:white_check_mark:](canny_edge_detection/)
Crude implementation of the Canny Edge Detector in order to outline cells from a microscope image.
